Embodied AI Development Studio
Welcome! We train robots.
What We Do
We provide expert consulting and development services in key areas of Embodied AI:
Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Imitation Learning (IL)
Data Retargeting: Efficiently adapting motion data (e.g., video-to-robot, simulation-to-robot) for direct use on your robotic platforms.
Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) Transfer: Employing techniques to minimize the performance gap when deploying policies trained in simulation onto real-world hardware.
Our Expertise: Tasks & Platforms
We have experience tackling a range of challenging embodied tasks across various platforms:
Core Tasks: Locomotion, Navigation, Manipulation.
Robot Morphologies:
Bipedal / Humanoid Robots
Quadrupedal Robots
Robotic Arms
(We are open to discussing other morphologies based on project requirements)
Simulators We Utilize
Our team is proficient with industry-standard and research-focused simulators:
NVIDIA Isaac Gym / Isaac Sim
Mujoco (including the JAX-accelerated MJX)
(We are adaptable and can potentially work with other simulators based on project needs and feasibility)
IsaacSim
IsaacGym
MuJoCo
SAPIEN
PyBullet
Genesis
Our Collaborative Approach
We believe in a transparent and iterative development process:
Agile Methodology: We work in sprints, focusing on delivering value incrementally.
Continuous Communication: We maintain regular contact, sharing progress updates frequently.
Client Feedback Loop: Your input is vital. We incorporate feedback throughout the development cycle to ensure alignment with your goals.
What You Receive (Deliverables)
Incrementally at every mini-milestone and upon successful completion of a project milestone or the entire engagement, you will typically receive:
Completed Project: Functionality delivered according to the agreed-upon scope.
Source Code: Well-documented code developed for the project.
Code Explanation: Walkthroughs and documentation to understand the implementation.
Results Presentation: A clear summary of the project outcomes, performance metrics, and key findings.
Our Team:
Our strength lies in our network of highly qualified experts:
Qualifications: The core development team consists of PhDs, Postdoctoral Researchers, and Professors specializing in AI, Robotics, and related fields.
Proven Track Record: Our team members actively contribute to the scientific community, with publications in top-tier conferences, including:
NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, ICML, ECCV (Core AI & ML)
ICRA, IROS, HRI, CASE (Robotics & Automation)
Confidentiality: Due to the high caliber of our talent pool and to protect their academic affiliations, we do not disclose specific team member identities before project engagement. However, you will directly interact with the experts assigned to your project during our regular meetings.
Why Choose Us? The Talent Advantage
Our unique position in the Embodied AI ecosystem provides significant benefits:
Unparalleled Network: Since 2022, our founder has cultivated relationships with over 500 PhD candidates, postdocs, professors, and leading labs across Europe, the United States, Australia, and China, initially through facilitating academic placements for PhD candidates.
Access to Top Talent: This extensive network allows us to assemble project teams of leading international researchers and engineers perfectly matched to your specific technical challenges. You benefit from world-class expertise that might otherwise be inaccessible.
Intellectual Property (IP) & Confidentiality
We prioritize the protection of your proprietary information:
IP Ownership: Our standard agreement stipulates that any unique insights, discoveries, or intellectual property generated specifically for your project, within the defined project dates, belongs exclusively to you in perpetuity. We retain no rights to project-specific IP.
Confidentiality: Your project details, data, and any shared information will be treated with strict confidentiality.
Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): We are prepared to sign a reasonable Non-Disclosure Agreement to formalize our commitment to confidentiality before any sensitive information is exchanged.
Business & Payment Information
Registered Entity: Our business is registered and operates under Australian law.
Australian Business Number (ABN): 15 971 310 324
Payment: All payments are to be wired to our designated Australian bank account.
Initial Payment: An initial payment equivalent to 25% of the total estimated project cost (based on the agreed-upon estimated hours and our standard rate) is required upon signing the contract. This deposit confirms the project engagement and serves as a mutual sign of commitment. Project work will commence once the signed contract and initial payment are received.
Ongoing Invoicing: Following the initial payment, you will receive invoices weekly detailing the hours worked during that period.
Payment Terms: Payment for all subsequent weekly invoices is due within two weeks (14 days) of the invoice date.
Pricing Policy
Minimum Rate: Our standard consulting rate is $300 USD per hour.
Non-Negotiable: This rate is firm and not subject to negotiation or bargaining. We believe this reflects the high level of expertise and value we provide.
Getting Started: Our Engagement Process
Initial Contact: Reach out to us via email, phone, or schedule a meeting. Provide a clear description of your project goals or a "to-do list."
Scope & Documentation: We will discuss the requirements in detail. You may send us relevant documents outlining the task.
Agreement & NDA: We finalize the project scope, estimated hours, and sign the Consulting Agreement and NDA.
Project Kick-off: Work commences upon agreement execution.
Regular Updates: You will have scheduled online meetings with our team members to discuss progress, review deliverables (including code), and address your questions.
Fee Calculation & Time Estimation
Hourly Billing: We operate on an hourly billing model based on the actual time spent by our team on your project.
Time Estimates & Tolerance: We will provide an upfront estimate of the hours required for specific tasks or milestones. Recognizing the inherent unpredictability in R&D, we operate with a +/- 20% tolerance on these estimates.
Example: If we estimate a task at 10 hours:
If we complete it efficiently in 8 hours, you are billed for 8 hours.
If unforeseen challenges require 12 hours, you are billed for 12 hours (within the +20% tolerance).
Transparency: This approach ensures fairness â€“ you pay for the work done, and we account for the complexities of research and development. We will communicate proactively if we anticipate exceeding the estimated time significantly beyond the tolerance.
Scope of Services: Delivery, Not Training
Focus: Our primary goal is to deliver working solutions and achieve the agreed-upon project milestones.
Knowledge Transfer: We provide thorough explanations of the code and methodologies used.
Client-Side Expertise: We expect your team to have appropriate engineering or technical personnel who can engage with our team, understand the explanations, and eventually maintain or build upon the delivered work.
No Upskilling Service: While we ensure clarity on our deliverables, our service is not designed as a training or upskilling program for your staff.
On-Site Collaboration
Possibility: Working on-site with your team may be possible under specific circumstances.
Considerations: This involves logistical complexities (Visas, travel arrangements, accommodation) and associated costs, which would be borne by the client.
Team Requirement: Due to our collaborative development approach, on-site engagements would typically require a minimum of two team members. We can discuss the feasibility and requirements if this is a critical need for your project.
